# Web Intelligence and Big Data >> Load
***
## Preamble
* big data technology, map-reduce and programming assignment
* why big data tech
 + Fault-tolerance at scale
 + variety of data types
 + large data volumes without archiving
 + parallelism
* a new approach to data-processing

***
## Parallel Computing
* speedup *S* = T_{1}/T_{p} time with *p* processors vs with one, efficiency *E* = T_{1}/pT_{p}
* scalable algorithm, E is propotional to n/p where n is "problem size"
* parallel programming paradigms
 + shared memory, partition work
 + message passing, partition data
* map-reduce: message-passing, data-parallel, pipelined work, high level

***
## Map-Reduce
* introduce the map-reduce model with word counting as an example
* map-reduce is like a batch-processing keeping producing fresh data

***
## Map-Reduce Example in Octo
* Octo.py

***
## Map-Reduce Applications
* database join using map-reduce
