# Social Network Analysis >> Random Graph Models
***
## intro remarks for week 2
* why network models are important

***
## random graphs and alternative models
* erdos-renyi model
* degree distribution
* average degree z = (n - 1) * p
* binomial distribution, possion distribution, normal distribution
* no hubs in network

***
## random graphs and alternative models
* introduction model, static geographical model, random encounter, growth model

***
## Models of network growth
* power-law distribution: ln(p(k)) = c - a*ln(k)
* preferential attachment, or cumulative advantage(Matthew effect)
* random network growth, change in degree k_{i} = m / t
* Barabasi-Albert model
